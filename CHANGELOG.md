# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Dameng DM8 Support:** each database entry now carries a `db_type` (`mysql`/`dameng`, defaults to `mysql` so existing configs migrate with zero changes). Dameng entries connect via `dmPython` (optional `dameng` extra: `pip install "mysql_mcp_server[dameng]"`), with DM-dialect metadata queries (`USER_TABLES`/`ALL_TABLES`/`ALL_TAB_COLUMNS`), double-quote identifiers, default port 5236, and `database` mapped to schema. All three tools, confirmation flow, audit, and alias/project matching work identically across both types. Admin UI gains a database-type selector. Single-file build (`build_remote.sh`) collects dmPython runtime libraries.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **C Extension Fallback:** Stopped forcing `use_pure=False` in the connection config by default. `mysql-connector-python` treats an explicit `use_pure=False` as a hard requirement for its C extension, raising `ImportError` instead of falling back to the pure-Python implementation when the extension can't load (e.g. built against a newer OpenSSL than the host provides, as with `mysql-connector-python` 26.7.0 on many Linux systems). `use_pure` is now only set when `MYSQL_USE_PURE` is explicitly configured.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **Missing Runtime Dependency:** `python-dotenv` is now declared as a required dependency. The server imports it directly, but `uvx`'s isolated environment doesn't install it automatically, causing a `ModuleNotFoundError` on startup (#95).
- **MCP 2.x Incompatibility:** Constrained the `mcp` dependency to `<2` since MCP 2.0 introduced breaking API changes this server has not been migrated to support, and the previous unbounded `>=1.2.0` allowed `uvx` to resolve an incompatible version (#95).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Package Metadata:** Split author entry into name-only (`Author:`) + maintainer-with-email (`Maintainer-email:`) so sites that read the legacy `Author` field (e.g. pypistats.org) display the author name correctly.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Cross-Database Support:** `get_schema_info` and `get_table_sample` now accept `database.table` notation, making their scope consistent with `execute_sql`. Bare table names continue to use `MYSQL_DATABASE`.
- **MCP Prompts:** Two guided workflow prompts usable as slash commands in supporting clients (e.g. Claude Desktop):
  - `explore_database` — walks through resource discovery, schema inspection, data sampling, and summarization.
  - `analyze_table` — schema + sample + query suggestions for a named table.
- **Package Metadata:** Added `Homepage`, `Repository`, `Issues`, and `Changelog` URLs, SPDX license expression, keywords, and classifiers to PyPI metadata.
- **Reproducible Builds:** Committed `uv.lock` so hosted build environments get pinned dependencies.

### Fixed
- **Multi-Statement Error:** `execute_sql` now returns a clear message ("Only single statements are supported…") instead of MySQL's cryptic "Commands out of sync" error when a multi-statement query is passed.

### Changed
- **Tool Descriptions:** All three tools have richer descriptions that say when to use them and what they return. Contributor credits moved out of tool descriptions.
- **Tool Annotations:** `get_schema_info` and `get_table_sample` now carry `readOnlyHint=True` so clients can distinguish them from destructive operations.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- **Strict LLM Compatibility:** Refactored resource names to be 'identifier-safe' (e.g., `table_users` instead of `Table: users`) to ensure compatibility with Google Gemini models and GitHub Copilot (Issue #39).
- **MySQL 5.7 Stability:** Added built-in support for `MYSQL_AUTH_PLUGIN`, `MYSQL_USE_PURE`, and `MYSQL_RAISE_ON_WARNINGS` to stabilize connections to older MySQL servers (Issue #31).

### Added
- **Standalone Execution:** Added `__main__.py` to allow running the package directly via `python -m mysql_mcp_server` (Issue #12).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- **Asynchronous Reliability:** Refactored all blocking database and SSH operations to use background threads via `anyio.to_thread.run_sync`. This prevents the server from hanging in environments like Windows 11 (Issue #54).
- **Graceful Error Reporting:** Implemented global exception handling in tool calls to return clear, actionable error messages to AI agents and users instead of silent failures (Issue #50).
- **Metadata Formatting:** Improved result set handling for `DESCRIBE`, `SHOW COLUMNS`, and other inspection queries, including explicit `NULL` value rendering (PR #38).
- **SQL Injection Risk:** Added strict regex validation for all database and table identifiers (PR #86).

### Added
- **Multi-Database Mode:** `MYSQL_DATABASE` is now optional. When omitted, the server lists all available databases and supports `USE <database>` or fully qualified table names (PR #86, Issue #68, #81).
- **SSH Tunneling:** Built-in support for secure remote database connections via an SSH jump host using `MYSQL_SSH_ENABLE` (PR #64, contributed by @GeorgeLeex).
- **New Inspection Tools:**
    - `get_schema_info`: Detailed column metadata, types, and comments.
    - `get_table_sample`: Quick data previews to understand table content (PR #64, contributed by @GeorgeLeex).
- **SSE/HTTP Transport:** Support for running as an HTTP server by setting `MCP_TRANSPORT=sse` (PR #86).
- **SSL/TLS Support:** Added `MYSQL_SSL_MODE` for encrypted connections.
- **Environment Management:** Added `.env` support and `.env.example` file (PR #69).

### Security
- Added `ToolAnnotations` to `execute_sql` to flag potentially destructive operations to AI agents (PR #78).
- Dockerfile now runs as a non-root `appuser` and follows best practices for secret management.
- Masked sensitive information (passwords, SSH keys) in server logs.

### Changed
- Refactored server initialization into distinct STDIO and SSE transport handlers.
- Updated minimum `mcp` dependency to `1.2.0` for improved stability and security.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-04-18

### Fixed
- Fixed handling of SQL commands that return result sets, including `SHOW INDEX`, `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, and `DESCRIBE`
- Added improved error handling for result fetching operations
- Added additional debug output to aid in troubleshooting

## [0.2.1] - 2025-02-15

### Added
- Support for MYSQL_PORT configuration through environment variables
- Documentation for PORT configuration in README

### Changed
- Updated tests to use handler functions directly
- Refactored database configuration to runtime

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-20

### Added
- Initial release with MCP server implementation
- Support for SQL queries through MCP interface
- Ability to list tables and read data
